      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake-up time is exactly 7, gonna be shown the statement like "I can take the bus to school". ]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the waking up time will not be 7,  it has to be shown statement like "I have to take aa car"]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[Than it has to be statement that character has to take car to school]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[After trying, zero recognized by the system as a integer number, so it will be positive]</p>
