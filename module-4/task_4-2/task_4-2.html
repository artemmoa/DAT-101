      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable, where each value is accessed by its index]</p>
      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").s]</li>
      <p>[Hardcoding is when you write fixed valures directly into code, and not making it reuseble or]</p>
      <li>[Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
(humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[In task 3 text constant text sentence has to be split into separate words like elements for array. We can use loops for checking length of array and then iterate through it.]</p>
      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[It helps to use functions for them freely, with easy operating numbers and not messing up with constants. We can use some functions to all elements at the same time, and manage them easily.]</p>
       <li>[Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
"Thursday", how would it ideally look?]</li>
      <p>[The object has elements for days of the week, and established combinations of them as separate elements. They all have a value, which used as a unic tag, and uses binary logic in there. Each day of a week has unique kind of bit value symbol, which lets to combine them with other and creating a combination of these tags to create new element, which includes other. An everything in onee object. For creating new element such as training days, we should write in value of it, tegs of the days which are included. So ti will look like" Workoutdays:{Value:  0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, name: "Trainging days"}
          ]</p>
       <li>[In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works]</li>
      <p>[Callback is an exxtra funnction for another function, which helps or acomplish it when needed. For sorting we help to show what to use as a sorting rule]</p>
       <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
both parameters each time the sorting routine runs]</li>
<p>[In callback function a-b program checks the result, and in case of negative number result, depending on sorting type b placed before, or after a. a and b are symbols for to numbers in array which stays next to eacho other.]</p>
<li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
contains.]</li>
 <p>[arrayP10 conteins several "row" arrays, so first element there is row. But in row array the first element is one "cell" with names numbers of row and column]</p>
