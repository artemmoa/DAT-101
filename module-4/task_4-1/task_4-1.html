      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[It is important because it helps to organize code into reusable objects, making it easier to manage and maintain, aplying different functionts to it, handling with objects created by others, etc]</p>
      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development]</li>
      <p>[This object helps to work with elements and not with texty strings, which is language independent, and more secure with mistakes. Olso very flexible and changeble, we can rename account type and do not c hange whole code]</p>
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?]</li>
      <p>[It helps to avoid unintended chenges to class, and so we can avoid potentioal bugs in more complex codes. We can create public with "this." and privat with "#"  ]</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[It creates a new object, or instance of a class, allowing us to use the properties and methods from that class.]</p>
